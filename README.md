# Power BI Profitability Analysis

This project is a beginner Power BI dashboard created as the final project for a Codecademy Power BI course. The goal was to take a sample dataset, analyze it in Power BI, gain hands-on experience using the software, and create a report that answers basic business questions about sales and profitability through the creation of various charts within two different dashboards.

## Project Overview

For this project, I was given a business scenario and two real CSV datasets from Kaggle. The task was to:

- Import and clean the data  
- Build relationships between two separate tables  
- Create meaningful visuals that demonstrate and analyze profit and sales  
- Design an interactive dashboard that provides powerful business insight 

The final result is a simple Power BI report that helps show which products, customers, and regions are most and least profitable.

## Data Sources

The project uses two sample CSV files from Kaggle:

- **List of Orders.csv** – customer and order information  
- **Order Details.csv** – product, profit, and quantity data  

These files were combined inside Power BI to create the final report.

## What I Learned

This project allowed me to gain experience using Power BI by means of:

- Importing and cleaning real data  
- Building relationships between tables  
- Creating charts and dashboards  
- Using slicers and filters  
- Cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting data from a business point of view  

Most importantly, I learned how to take raw data and turn it into something useful and easy to understand.

## Insights From the Project

While working with the data, it allowed me to think like a data analyst and consider these business perspectives:

- Some product categories are more profitable than others  
- A few customers create a large portion of losses  
- Profit changes a lot depending on the region  
- High sales don’t always mean high profit  

These are the kinds of insights a company could use to improve decisions moving forward, and visualizing data helps translate the message effectively.
